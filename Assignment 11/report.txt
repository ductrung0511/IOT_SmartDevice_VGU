This Arduino sketch utilizes the TinyGPSPlus library with an ESP32 and a GPS module connected to UART2 (RX pin 16, TX pin 17)
to collect and display a wide range of GPS data every five seconds. The code begins by initializing the serial communication with both the Serial Monitor and the GPS module.
In the main loop, it reads incoming GPS data continuously using gps.encode() and processes it to extract valuable information.

Every 5 seconds, the code prints a comprehensive report to the Serial Monitor,
including location coordinates (latitude and longitude), altitude above sea level, speed in kilometers per hour, course direction in degrees, current UTC date and time, 
number of visible satellites, and the Horizontal Dilution of Precision (HDOP), which indicates the accuracy of the GPS fix.

Each data point is validated using isValid() before printing to ensure that only accurate, available information is displayed. 
If a data point is invalid, it prints “INVALID” as a fallback. This makes the program highly reliable for real-world applications such as IoT-based tracking, logging, or navigation systems.
The code is modular and can be easily extended to log GPS data to storage, display it on an OLED, or send it to a cloud server.
